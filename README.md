# Movies-ETL.
Amazing Prime video would like to know which low budget movies are being released and would become popular so they can buy streaming rights for those movies. In order to do so, they are conducting a hackathon and the participants are required to predict which will be the popular movies. Participants are being provided clean data extracted from two different sources (Wikipedia and Movie Lens ratings data) and we are going to transform and club it together using the power of Python and regular expressions. The transformed data will then be stored in SQL database POSTGRES.
